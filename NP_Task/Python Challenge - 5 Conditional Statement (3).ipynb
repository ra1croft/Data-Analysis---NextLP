        "## **1. What are Conditional Statements?**\n",
        "\n",
        "Conditional statements are instructions in a program that allow decisions to be made. The program evaluates an expression (a condition), and based on whether it is `True` or `False`, executes a specific block of code.\n",
        "\n",
        "### **How It Works**\n",
        "- Python uses the keywords `if`, `else`, and `elif` to implement conditional logic.\n",
        "- A condition is an expression that evaluates to either `True` or `False` (Boolean values).\n",
        "- Python uses indentation to define which code belongs to a specific condition.\n",
        "\n",
        "---\n",
        "\n",
        "## **2. `if` Statements**\n",
        "\n",
        "The `if` statement is the simplest conditional. If the condition evaluates to `True`, the indented code block under the `if` is executed. If the condition evaluates to `False`, the block is skipped.\n",

        "```\n",
        "\n",
