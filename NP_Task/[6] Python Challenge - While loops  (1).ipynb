        "2. **Condition Check**:\n",

        "   - If `False`, the loop exits.\n",

        "    print(\"This is an infinite loop!\")\n",

        "\n",
        "#### **How It Works**:\n",
        "- The condition `True` never changes, so the loop continues indefinitely.\n",
        "- Such loops must be manually terminated (e.g., with `Ctrl+C` in the terminal).\n",
        "\n",
        "#### **Real-World Use Case**:\n",
        "Infinite loops are useful for programs that wait for events, such as:\n",
        "- Chatbots waiting for user input.\n",
        "- Servers listening for incoming connections.\n",

        "### **2. Preventing Infinite Loops**\n",
        "\n",
        "To avoid infinite loops:\n",
        "1. Ensure that the loop condition eventually evaluates to `False`.\n",
        "2. Use appropriate updates to loop variables within the loop.\n",
        "\n",
        "#### **Example**:\n",
        "```python\n",
        "counter = 1\n",
        "while counter <= 5:\n",
        "    print(\"Counter:\", counter)\n",
        "    counter += 1  # Without this, the loop would run forever\n",

        "---\n",
        "\n",
        "### **3. Using `break` to Exit an Infinite Loop**\n",
        "\n",
        "The `break` statement allows you to exit a loop prematurely. It’s particularly useful in infinite loops where you want to stop under specific conditions.\n",
        "\n",
        "#### **Example**:\n",
        "```python\n",
        "while True:\n",
        "    user_input = input(\"Type 'exit' to stop the loop: \")\n",
        "    if user_input.lower() == \"exit\":\n",
        "        print(\"Exiting the loop...\")\n",
        "        break\n",
        "    print(\"You entered:\", user_input)\n",
        "```\n",
        "\n",
        "**How It Works**:\n",
        "- The loop runs infinitely with `while True`.\n",
        "- The `break` statement terminates the loop when the user types `\"exit\"`.\n",
        "\n",
        "---\n",
        "\n",
        "### **4. Using `continue` to Skip Iterations**\n",
        "\n",
        "The `continue` statement skips the current iteration and jumps to the next one.\n",
        "\n",
        "#### **Example**:\n",
        "```python\n",
        "number = 0\n",
        "while number < 10:\n",
        "    number += 1\n",
        "    if number % 2 == 0:\n",
        "        continue  # Skip even numbers\n",
        "    print(\"Odd number:\", number)\n",
        "```\n",
        "\n",
        "**Output**:\n",
        "```\n",
        "Odd number: 1\n",
        "Odd number: 3\n",
        "Odd number: 5\n",
        "Odd number: 7\n",
        "Odd number: 9\n",
        "```\n",
        "\n",
        "**How It Works**:\n",
